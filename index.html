        <h1 class="page-header" id="Bio">Bio</h1> <hr>
        <p>Born in 1981, in Upper Silesia, Poland.<br></p>
		<p>Interested in computers since early childhood (first played with ZX Spectrum when I was six).
		Started programming in secondary school. Assembly language as the first lamguage to learn 
		was not that miserable choice after all. Did some 3D graphics programming at the time 
		of OpenGL 1.3.  
		</p>
		<p>Got interested in Linux and open source at the university. Keen Slackware user, moved 
		to Gentoo and ended up with Ubuntu.</p>
		<p>Started professional career during 4th year of university. Hired as a C developer 
		with C-ISAM database knowledge. Left the company's main system modernized, to a web based 
		application using ASP.NET, JavaScript, SQL and handcrafted Ajax (it was dark times of ASP.NET 1.1).
		<p>Moved to Intel, starting as a software engineer. Worked on the V-Pro, the most notably 
		on the integration with Windows IT services. Next, lead enabling the 3rd party components 
		on V-Pro. Following years, brought work on the industry standards (USB), the USB 3.1 and xHCI
		as a software engineer for Windows driver stack. Experience gained in USB allowed to shape
		the industry with the development of new technology: WiGig (aka 802.11ad). The WiGig required
		the USB adaptation layer and that is how MA USB standard was crafted.
		<p>Currently switched to Android domain as a SW architect for Intel Audio HAL.</p>
